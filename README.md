LacCalc is an iOS application which stores the lactic acid tests of competitive rowers. Users can input their split and lactic acid level, and use the app to perform a calculation in order find the optimal training zone. Users can also view graphs, input additional data such as stroke rate and drag factor, and connect to bluetooth heart rate monitors.
