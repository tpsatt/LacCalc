\f0\fs24 \cf0 LacCalc is an iOS application which stores lactic acid tests of competitive rowers. Users can input their split and lactic acid level, then the app will perform a calculation in order to best optimize the rower's training. Users can also view graphs, input optional data such as stroke rate and drag factor, and connect to bluetooth heart rate monitors, or bluetooth PM5 ergometer monitors.}
